Project: Final_project

Scenario: Default Scenario

  1 populations simulated for 100 years for 100 iterations


Sequence of events in each time cycle:

Extinction defined as no males or no females.

Inbreeding depression with a genetic load consisting of 
  6.29 total lethal equivalents per individual, of which
  50% are due to recessive lethals,
  and the remainder are lethal equivalents not subjected to removal by selection.

Populations:

  Population1


Reproductive System:

  Polygyny, with new selection of mates each year
  Females breed from age 1 to age 10
  Males breed from age 1 to age 10
  Maximum age of survival: 10
  Sex ratio (percent males) at birth: 50

Independence between EV in reproduction and survival.


Population specific rates for Population1

  Percent of adult females breeding each year: 100
    with EV(SD): 10
  Percent of adult males in the pool of breeders: 100
  Normal distribution of brood size with mean: 2.5 with SD: 1

  Female annual mortality rates (as percents):
    Age 0 to 1:    20 with EV(SD): 10
    After age 1:    20 with EV(SD): 3

  Male annual mortality rates (as percents):
    Age 0 to 1:    20 with EV(SD): 10
    After age 1:    20 with EV(SD): 3

  Catastrophe 1: Catastrophe1

  Catastrophe 2: Catastrophe2
    Local impact
    Frequency (%): 1
    Reproduction reduced by severity multiplier: 1
